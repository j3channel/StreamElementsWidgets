# STREAMELEMENTS WIDGETS
We've created some Widgets that you can integrate with your own StreamElements overlays! Keep checking back as I'll be adding more widgets as I create them.

*All instructions on how to use are included in all README.md files*

## Channel Points
Widgets that can be integrated with Twitch Channel Points.

**Auto-Timeout** - Automatically trigger the Twitch Chat /timeout command when a user redeems a channel point reward. This can time out the redeemer or a user that the redeemer chooses.

**Shuffler** - Write a random item from a list into chat when a user redeems a channel point reward.

**Slash-Bot** - Automatically trigger Twitch Chat commands (/commercial, /emoteonly, /timeout) when a channel point reward is redeemed. (Includes all **Auto-Timeout** functionality).

**Sound Player** - Play sounds when channel points are redeemed.

**Video Player** - Play videos on-screen when channel points are redeemed.

## Chat
Widgets that can be integrated with your chat.

**Greeter** - Show an on-screen welcome message when a viewer types in chat for the first time!

**iPhone Alert** - Show an on-screen iPhone-style notification displaying a user's message when a viewer types in chat for the first time.

**Sequence** - A chat-bot widget that will respond to a sequence of messages in chat, then play an audio alert when the sequence has completed.
